## **What is Open Science UMontreal?**

### Vision

* We believe in a world in which all society members  has free access to the creative processes, content, and benefits of scientific research. 

* We hope to grow a community of empowered people championing open-science-principles such as inclusiveness, collaboration, transparency, and working towards science for common good.

* We strongly believe that openness will encourage greater collaboration, allowing us in the long term to effectively solve the problems science is facing,  and will be facing in the future.
