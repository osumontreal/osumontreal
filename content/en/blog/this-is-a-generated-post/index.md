According to the authors, the central concern of the school is to make science accessible to a wider audience. The inherent assumption of this school, as described by the authors, is that the newer communication technologies such as Web 2.0 allow scientists to open up the research process and also allow scientist to better prepare their "products of research" for interested non-experts. Hence, the school is characterized by two broad streams: one argues for the access of the research process to the masses, whereas the other argues for increased access to the scientific product to the public.

The widespread adoption of the institution of the scientific journal marks the beginning of the modern concept of open science. Before this time societies pressured scientists into secretive behaviors.

Before the advent of scientific journals, scientists had little to gain and much to lose by publicizing scientific discoveries.

These cases are representative of a system of aristocratic patronage in which scientists received funding to develop either immediately useful things or to entertain.

The exact phrase "Open Science" was coined by Steve Mann in 1998 at which time he also registered the domain name openscience.com and openscience.org which he sold to degruyter.com in 2011.
